# Expense Tracker

## Application Description

This application allows for basic expense tracking as you are able to create, read, update, and delete expenses that you create.  It has the fundamental functions of what the application is supposed to be capable of but does not have more than that.  The current implementation has user authentication so only an authenticated user will be able to log in and use the app, and the authenticated user will only be able to see information that they create and not other users' data.  This project is my first attempt at using React Native so please forgive the rough edges and lack of quality of life functionality.  However, I hope you give this application a try and enjoy what you see.  Happy tracking!
